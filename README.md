# Country Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning for HELP International
This project is a case study for HELP International, a non-governmental organization that wants to expand its operations. To do so efficiently, they need to know which countries require their help the most, based on various socio-economic and health indicators.

Used unsupervised machine learning (clustering) to group countries based on their development levels.

🎯 Project Goal
The main objective is to:

Categorize countries into different groups based on features like income, education, health, and environment. This helps the NGO focus its efforts on underdeveloped or developing countries.

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains real-world information about countries and includes features like:

income: Income per person (GDP per capita)

child_mortality: Deaths of children under 5 per 1000 births

life_expectancy: Average number of years a person is expected to live

fertility: Average number of children per woman

literacy: Adult literacy rate

CO2_emissions: CO2 emissions per capita

These features reflect each country's overall quality of life and development.

🧭 Step-by-Step Process
1️⃣ Data Understanding
We start by exploring the dataset to know what it looks like and what kind of data we’re dealing with.

Viewed the data structure using .head() and .info()

Checked data types of each column (numerical/categorical)

Used .describe() to see the mean, median, min, max, etc., of each feature

Plotted histograms and box plots to see distributions and outliers

Identified correlated features using a heatmap

✅ Goal: Get a clear idea of what each column means and how data is spread.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning
Next, we clean the data to make it usable:

Missing values: Some columns had missing data. We either filled them using the mean/median or removed them if necessary.

Inconsistent formats: Some numbers were stored as text (e.g., "12,000"). We fixed them by converting to proper numerical format.

Duplicates: Checked for and removed any repeated rows.

Outliers: Found extreme values using box plots and statistical methods (like z-score) and handled them carefully.

✅ Goal: Ensure the data is accurate, complete, and consistent.

3️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Before applying machine learning, the data must be in the right form.

Feature Scaling:

Used StandardScaler to scale features so that they all contribute equally to the model.

Example: income and child_mortality have different units. Without scaling, large numbers dominate the model.

Dimensionality Reduction:

Used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the number of features while keeping important information.

Helps in faster processing and better visualization.

Final Dataset: A clean, scaled, and compact version of the original dataset.

✅ Goal: Prepare the dataset for accurate and meaningful clustering.

4️⃣ Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
Here we apply algorithms to group the countries without using any predefined labels.

🔹 K-Means Clustering
Chose the number of clusters using:

Elbow Method: Plots the error vs. number of clusters and looks for a “bend” (elbow).

Silhouette Score: Measures how well each point fits in its cluster.

Trained the model to divide countries into 3 main clusters.

Plotted the clusters to visually interpret the groups.

🔹 Hierarchical Clustering
Used dendrograms to see how countries can be grouped step by step.

Provided another way to validate our K-means clusters.

✅ Goal: Classify countries into groups like "Low development", "Medium development", and "High development".

📈 Key Insights
After clustering, we found:

One cluster contains high-income, high-literacy, high-life-expectancy countries (developed countries).

Another cluster contains countries with high child mortality and low income (underdeveloped).

The third cluster represents developing countries with moderate indicators.

📌 This allows HELP International to focus their resources on the most vulnerable countries.
